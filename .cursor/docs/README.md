## 📝 Documentation Categories Explained

### Guides vs. Architecture
- **Guides** are step-by-step instructions for setup and configuration
- **Architecture** documents system design, components, and data flow

### Planning vs. Analysis
- **Planning** documents are forward-looking: roadmaps, design documents, implementation plans
- **Analysis** documents are analytical: competitive research, thought pieces, comparative studies

### Protocols vs. Philosophy
- **Protocols** are operational procedures: how to navigate, how to operate
- **Philosophy** is conceptual exploration: why we build this way, semantic space mapping

### Status
- **Status** tracks current state: what's done, what's pending, what's next

## 🔍 For LLM Agents

When navigating this documentation:

1. **Start with the category** that matches your query type:
   - Setup question → `guides/`
   - Architecture question → `architecture/`
   - Operational question → `protocols/`
   - Planning question → `planning/`
   - Analysis question → `analysis/`
   - Conceptual question → `philosophy/`
   - Status question → `status/`

2. **Use the README links** to navigate directly to relevant documents

3. **Follow cross-references** within documents for deeper context

4. **Check STATUS.md first** if you need to understand what's implemented vs. planned
