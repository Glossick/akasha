# Support Ticket: MegaConstruct Churn Threat
**Ticket ID**: #0847
**Date**: May 3, 2024
**Customer**: MegaConstruct
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Assigned**: Sarah

## Initial Message from David (VP Ops, MegaConstruct)

Subject: Need to discuss pricing - considering alternatives

Sarah,

I need to talk to someone about our account. We signed in March at $299/month, but I just got an email about being "grandfathered" at $99 and that new customers at our size pay $299 or $999.

This doesn't sit right with me. We're one of your bigger customers, we're using this heavily (my team has generated 247 estimates in the past 6 weeks), and now I learn we were essentially overcharged compared to earlier customers?

I've been looking at competitors. ConstructFlow offers similar features at $149/month with no user limits. I need a call ASAP to discuss whether we're going to continue with EstiMate.

## Sarah's Internal Notes

**OH SHIT**. This is bad. David misunderstood the grandfather clause—he thought it meant early customers get $99 forever and he's paying $299. He doesn't realize he IS getting a deal because without the clause he'd be at $999 (Enterprise tier for his size).

I need to loop in Henry immediately. MegaConstruct is our biggest customer by far. If they churn, that's a huge blow to our growth story right before we close funding.

## Sarah's Response (Draft - sent to Henry & Steven for review first)

Hi David,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand the confusion and I apologize for the unclear communication. Let me clarify:

**What "grandfather clause" means**: Customers who signed before April 1st (including MegaConstruct) are locked in at their original price for 12 months. You're paying $299/month, which you'll continue to pay through March 2025.

**What would happen without grandfather clause**: Based on your team size (200 employees) and usage (247 estimates in 6 weeks!), you would typically fall into our Enterprise tier at $999/month. So you're actually getting a significant discount.

**Why the pricing changed**: When you signed, we were still figuring out our pricing. We realized $299 was too low for the value we provide to enterprise customers like you. New enterprise customers pay $999/month.

That said, I hear your frustration about competitors. Can we schedule a call to discuss? I want to make sure you're getting the value you expect, and if there are features or support improvements we can make, I'd love to hear that feedback.

Would tomorrow at 2pm work for a call?

Best,
Sarah

## Internal Slack Discussion

**Sarah** [10:45 AM] @Henry @Steven URGENT - MegaConstruct threatening to churn. See ticket #0847.

**Henry** [10:52 AM] Fuck. This is my fault - the grandfather clause email was confusing. I should have been clearer.

**Steven** [10:55 AM] Can we offer them a discount? Keep them at $299 permanently instead of just 12 months?

**Sarah** [10:58 AM] That could work but it sets a precedent. Every customer will threaten to churn to get a special deal.

**Henry** [11:03 AM] We can't lose them right now. The funding round depends on showing growth. Let me get on a call with David. Sarah, your draft response is good - send it. I'll follow up with a call.

**Sarah** [11:05 AM] Sent. Standing by.

## Status: OPEN
Awaiting customer response to schedule call.
