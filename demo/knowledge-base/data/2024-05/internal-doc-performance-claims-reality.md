# Internal Analysis: Marketing Claims vs Reality
**Date**: May 25, 2024
**Author**: Sarah
**Type**: Internal Audit

## Context
Our marketing website claims "EstiMate reduces estimation time by 10x." I wanted to verify this claim against actual customer data to ensure we're being honest and accurate.

## Methodology
I analyzed usage data from all active customers over the past 3 months:
- Time spent in EstiMate per estimate (tracked by session analytics)
- Customer-reported time savings (from onboarding surveys and calls)
- Before/after comparisons where available

## Findings

### Actual Time Savings by Customer

**BuildCorp**: 
- Before: 6-8 hours per estimate
- After: 60-90 minutes per estimate
- **Improvement**: ~5-6x faster

**ConsultPro**:
- Before: 10-12 hours per estimate (complex engineering projects)
- After: 2-3 hours per estimate
- **Improvement**: ~4-5x faster

**MegaConstruct**:
- Before: 8-12 hours per estimate
- After: 90 minutes - 2 hours per estimate
- **Improvement**: ~5-6x faster

**PrecisionEng**:
- Before: 4-6 hours per estimate (already fairly efficient)
- After: 45-60 minutes per estimate
- **Improvement**: ~5-6x faster

**Average across all customers**: **4-6x faster**, not 10x

## The "10x" Claim

The 10x claim comes from BuildCorp's CEO Marcus in our first sales call. He said: "What takes us 6-8 hours could be done in 30-45 minutes with automation."

However, in practice:
- Most estimates still take 60-90 minutes in EstiMate
- Users need to review, customize, and validate AI-generated estimates
- Complex estimates require more manual intervention
- Learning curve means first estimates are slower

## Implications

**The good news**: 4-6x is still massive time savings. That's hundreds of hours saved per customer per year.

**The problem**: We're overpromising with "10x" and potentially disappointing customers or prospects who expect that level of improvement.

## Recommendations

1. **Update marketing claims** to "5x faster estimates" or "reduce estimation time by 80%" (both are accurate)
2. **Add qualifiers**: "Up to 10x faster for simple estimates, 4-6x average improvement"
3. **Be specific**: Show actual customer time savings in case studies rather than generic multipliers
4. **Internal honesty**: Let's measure and report real numbers, even if they're less impressive

## Discussion Notes

**Henry's reaction** (via email): "I hear you but 5x doesn't sound as good as 10x from a marketing perspective. Can we at least say 'up to 10x'?"

**Sarah's response**: "We can, but it needs to be clear that's the best case, not the norm. I'd rather underpromise and overdeliver."

**Steven's input**: "I agree with Sarah. 10x was always aspirational. 5x is still amazing and it's honest. Let's change the messaging."

## Decision: Pending
Bringing this to Friday's founders meeting for final decision.
