# Customer Call: MegaConstruct Retention
**Date**: May 4, 2024
**Attendees**: Henry, Sarah, David (MegaConstruct VP Ops)
**Type**: Account Crisis / Retention

## Call Notes

Henry: David, thanks for making time on short notice. I want to apologize for the confusion around our pricing update.

David: I appreciate that. I was pretty frustrated yesterday, but Sarah's email clarified things. I didn't realize we'd be in the $999 tier without the grandfather pricing.

Sarah: You're absolutely one of our top customers. 247 estimates in 6 weeks is fantastic usage. That tells me the product is delivering value.

David: It is. My team loves it. The time savings are real—we estimated it's saving us about 300 hours per month, which is like... two full-time employees worth of productivity.

Henry: That's incredible ROI. At $299/month, you're getting massive value. But I also heard you mention competitors. Is there something we're missing?

David: Honestly, I was frustrated and started looking around. ConstructFlow is cheaper, but after looking closely, they don't have half the features you have. Your API is a game-changer—we're integrating with our project management system next week.

Henry: I'm glad to hear that. Here's what I want to propose: Instead of the grandfather pricing expiring in March 2025, we'll lock you in at $299 permanently. You'll never pay more than that as long as you're a customer.

David: Really? Even if we grow to 500 employees?

Henry: Yes. You're an early believer in EstiMate. We don't forget that. And frankly, we learn so much from how you use the product. You push us to build better.

David: That's... very generous. I accept. And I'm sorry for the angry email. I should have called first.

Sarah: No apology needed. We should have communicated the pricing changes more clearly. This is a learning for us.

David: Deal. We're staying. And actually, I have a colleague at InfraWorks—they do infrastructure construction. They're looking for an estimation tool. Want an intro?

Henry: Absolutely. Thank you David.

## Post-Call Internal Notes

**Henry**: Crisis averted. We kept them at $299 forever. It's below market rate but losing them would have been catastrophic.

**Sarah**: Agreed. And the InfraWorks intro is a nice bonus. This turned into a win.

**Steven** (via Slack): Good save. But we need to tighten up our communication on pricing changes. This shouldn't have happened.

**Henry**: 100%. I'll write clearer customer emails from now on. And we need to think about how we handle pricing for early customers long-term. We can't give everyone special deals.
