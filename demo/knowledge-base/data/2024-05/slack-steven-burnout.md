I can't do this anymore

**Henry** [11:25 PM]
What's wrong? You okay?

**Steven** [11:27 PM]
I'm working 14 hour days. Every day. Including weekends. I haven't taken a day off in 3 months. I'm handling all the development, all the customer technical issues, all the architecture decisions. And we keep signing bigger customers with bigger demands.

**Steven** [11:28 PM]
MegaConstruct wants custom integrations. PrecisionEng wants webhooks. ConsultPro is still complaining about performance even though I optimized everything. I'm one person and I feel like I'm failing everyone.

**Henry** [11:30 PM]
You're not failing. You've kept the system running with 7 customers while building new features. That's incredible.

**Steven** [11:32 PM]
It doesn't feel incredible. It feels like I'm drowning and no one sees it.

**Henry** [11:35 PM]
I see it. I'm sorry I haven't been more aware. What do you need?

**Steven** [11:38 PM]
Honestly? A week off. And then we need to hire an engineer. Like, immediately. Not "after we close funding" - NOW.

**Henry** [11:42 PM]
Take the week. Starting Monday. I'll handle any critical issues that come up, and Sarah can triage support tickets. As for hiring... you're right. We need to figure it out even if the funding timing isn't perfect.

**Steven** [11:45 PM]
Can we afford it?

**Henry** [11:47 PM]
We'll make it work. Your health and sanity are more important than runway calculations. Let me think about creative options - contractor to start, deferred salary, whatever works.

**Steven** [11:50 PM]
Thanks man. I just needed to hear that someone gets it.

**Henry** [11:52 PM]
I get it. And I'm sorry it took you breaking down at midnight for me to realize how bad it was. Take the week. We'll figure out hiring when you get back.

**Steven** [11:55 PM]
