Just talked to BuildCorp. They're loving the product but asked if we have a team plan. They want to add 5 more users.

**Henry** [2:36 PM]
That's great! We should probably think about tiered pricing. $99 for unlimited users doesn't make sense if they're growing.

**Steven** [2:38 PM]
Yeah... I'm kicking myself for not building that into the pricing from day one. What if we do per-seat pricing?

**Henry** [2:42 PM]
Most SaaS companies do per-seat. But usage-based might be better—charge per estimate generated. Aligns with value.

**Steven** [2:45 PM]
I like usage-based in theory but it makes revenue unpredictable. And some months they might not use it much.

**Henry** [2:47 PM]
Fair point. Let's table this for now. For BuildCorp, let's just keep them at $99 and see how much they actually use it. We need more data.

**Steven** [2:48 PM]
👍 Agree. But we need to figure this out before we sign more customers.
