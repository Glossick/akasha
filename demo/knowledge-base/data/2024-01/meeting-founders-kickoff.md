# Founders Kickoff Meeting
**Date**: January 5, 2024
**Attendees**: Henry, Steven
**Type**: Internal Planning

## Discussion

Henry: We're officially launching EstiMate next week. BuildCorp signed the LOI yesterday at $99 per month. They're a small construction company, about 15 people, doing residential projects.

Steven: $99 feels low for what we're building. We're automating their entire estimation workflow.

Henry: I know, but we need to get our first customer and prove the concept. We can always increase pricing later. BuildCorp's CEO, Marcus, is enthusiastic. He said their current process takes 6-8 hours per estimate, and he's hoping we can cut that to under an hour.

Steven: The architecture is solid. I built it as a monolith with PostgreSQL and a React frontend. Should handle 50-100 users easily. We have the PDF export feature working, basic collaboration, and the estimation engine is pretty smart.

Henry: Good. I'm focusing on sales this month. I have 5 meetings lined up with other construction firms. Also starting a LinkedIn content strategy to build awareness.

Steven: I'll handle customer success with BuildCorp while building out the API that larger customers will need. Marcus mentioned they might want to integrate with their accounting software.

Henry: Let's plan to meet weekly on Fridays to sync up. We need to be disciplined about this—it's just the two of us for now.

Steven: Agreed. Our burn rate is about $8k per month with hosting and tools. We have enough runway for 6 months from our savings.

## Action Items
- Henry: Close BuildCorp deal, continue outreach
- Steven: Prepare onboarding for BuildCorp, start API planning
- Both: Weekly sync every Friday at 2pm
