# Customer Call: BuildCorp Onboarding
**Date**: January 22, 2024
**Attendees**: Henry, Steven, Marcus (BuildCorp CEO)
**Type**: Customer Onboarding

## Call Notes

Marcus: Thanks for getting us set up so quickly. I've been testing EstiMate for the past week and I'm impressed. We did our first estimate yesterday and it took about 90 minutes instead of the usual 6 hours.

Henry: That's fantastic! A 75% time reduction is huge.

Marcus: Yeah, the team is excited. I want to roll this out to our entire estimating team—that's 5 people total. What does that look like pricing-wise?

Steven: We're keeping it simple for now. $99 per month covers your whole team. No per-seat charges.

Marcus: Really? That seems too cheap. Are you sure you don't want to charge more? I was expecting at least $50 per user.

Henry: We appreciate that Marcus. Right now we're focused on learning from our early customers. As we add more features and prove the ROI, we'll revisit pricing. But for early adopters like you, we want to keep it affordable.

Marcus: I'm not complaining! One thing—we'd love to be able to export estimates as PDFs with our company branding. Right now the PDFs are pretty generic.

Steven: Good feedback. That's definitely on our roadmap. I'm also working on an API so you can integrate with your other tools.

Marcus: API would be great. We use QuickBooks for accounting and it would be amazing to push estimates directly there.

Henry: We'll keep you updated on both fronts. And Marcus, if you know other construction companies who might benefit, we'd love an introduction.

Marcus: Actually, I know the CEO of UrbanDesign—they do urban planning and architecture. Not exactly construction but they do estimates too. I'll make an intro.

Henry: That would be amazing. Thank you!
