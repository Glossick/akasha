# Customer Call: MegaConstruct Signup
**Date**: March 28, 2024
**Attendees**: Henry, Sarah, David (MegaConstruct VP of Operations)
**Type**: Sales Call

## Call Notes

Henry: David, thanks for taking the time. I know BuildCorp referred you to us.

David: Yeah, Marcus raves about EstiMate. MegaConstruct is much bigger than BuildCorp—we're 200 employees, doing commercial construction projects. We do about 50-75 estimates per month, each one takes our team 8-12 hours currently.

Sarah: That's significant volume. If we can cut that time in half, you're talking about hundreds of hours saved per month.

David: Exactly. That's why I'm interested. Walk me through pricing.

Henry: We just launched new pricing tiers. For your size, we'd recommend our Professional plan at $299 per month. That includes up to 50 users, API access, and priority support.

David: $299 is nothing compared to the labor cost we're saving. What about the API? We need to integrate with our project management system and accounting software.

Henry: Our API launches next month—April 30 is the target. You'd get immediate access as a Professional tier customer.

David: Next month works. What about implementation? How long to get our team onboarded?

Sarah: I handle customer success. Typically we can get you fully onboarded in 2-3 weeks. I'll work directly with your team to import historical data, train users, and ensure everything's configured correctly.

David: Sounds good. Let's move forward. I want to start with a 3-month trial to prove out the ROI, then we'll commit annually if it works.

Henry: That's fair. We'll get the contract over today. Welcome to EstiMate!

## Post-Call Notes (Internal)

Sarah: MegaConstruct is 20x the size of our other customers. This is a big test.

Henry: Huge validation. If we succeed with them, we can go up-market. If we fail...

Sarah: We won't fail. But Steven needs to know they'll be heavy users. The performance issues better be resolved.

Henry: I'll talk to him today.
