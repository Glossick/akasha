# Customer Call: TinyBuilders Check-in
**Date**: March 30, 2024
**Attendees**: Sarah, Mike (TinyBuilders Owner)
**Type**: Customer Health Check

## Call Notes

Sarah: Hi Mike, thanks for making time. I wanted to check in because I noticed your team hasn't logged into EstiMate in about two weeks. Everything okay?

Mike: Oh, yeah, everything's fine. We've just been busy with active projects and haven't had new estimates to do.

Sarah: Got it. How was the experience when you were using it? Any feedback on the tool?

Mike: Honestly, it's probably overkill for us. We're a small operation—just me and two crew members. We do maybe 3-4 estimates per month, and they're pretty simple. Residential remodeling, nothing complicated.

Sarah: I see. What was your estimation process before EstiMate?

Mike: I just use a spreadsheet. Takes me maybe 30-45 minutes per estimate. EstiMate is fancier but I'm not sure it saves me much time for the kinds of projects we do.

Sarah: That's helpful feedback. Our product is probably better suited for companies doing more complex estimates or higher volume. For 3-4 simple estimates per month, a spreadsheet might be more efficient.

Mike: Yeah. I mean, EstiMate works fine, but I'm paying $99/month and not really getting my money's worth. I don't want to be rude, but I'm probably going to cancel at the end of this billing cycle.

Sarah: I appreciate your honesty, Mike. No hard feelings at all. Can I ask—what would make EstiMate worth it for a business your size?

Mike: I don't know. Maybe if it was like $20/month? Or if I was doing way more estimates. As it is, it's a nice tool but just not necessary for me.

Sarah: That makes sense. Thank you for trying us out. If your business grows or your needs change, we'll be here. And I won't try to talk you out of canceling—it sounds like we're not the right fit right now.

Mike: I appreciate that. You guys have been great. It's just a business decision.

Sarah: Understood. Good luck with TinyBuilders!

## Post-Call Internal Notes

**Sarah**: TinyBuilders is going to churn. Not worth fighting for—they're right that we're overkill for their use case. Our product is built for mid-size+ companies with complex estimates and high volume.

**Lesson**: We need to qualify leads better. Not every construction company is a good fit. Target should be 10+ employees, 20+ estimates/month, or complex estimation requirements.

**Action**: Update sales qualification criteria to avoid signing customers like TinyBuilders who will inevitably churn.
