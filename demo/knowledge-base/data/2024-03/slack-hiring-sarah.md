# Slack Conversation: Hiring Sarah
**Date**: March 12, 2024
**Channel**: #founders-private

**Henry** [9:15 AM]
I can't keep up with customer calls + sales + support tickets. We have 5 customers now and I'm drowning.

**Steven** [9:22 AM]
Same. I'm coding 12 hours a day and still behind on ConsultPro's performance issues.

**Henry** [9:25 AM]
We need to hire. I think customer success is the biggest gap. Someone to handle onboarding, support tickets, renewals.

**Steven** [9:30 AM]
Agree but can we afford it? We're making maybe $500/month in revenue and burning $8k.

**Henry** [9:33 AM]
I know but we can't grow without help. I have a candidate—Sarah Chen. She was CSM at a B2B SaaS company, 4 years experience. She's looking for an early-stage startup role.

**Steven** [9:40 AM]
What's she want salary-wise?

**Henry** [9:42 AM]
$80k + 1% equity. It's below market but she's excited about the mission.

**Steven** [9:48 AM]
That's $6.6k/month. We can do that for maybe 4-5 months before we run out of money. We need to close the funding round soon.

**Henry** [9:50 AM]
I'm working on it. I have 3 angel conversations going. But yes, hiring Sarah is a bet on closing funding in Q2.

**Steven** [9:55 AM]
Let's do it. I trust your judgment and I genuinely can't keep doing customer calls while writing code. When can she start?

**Henry** [9:57 AM]
March 25. I'll send her the offer today.

**Steven** [10:00 AM]
🎉 Welcome to the team, Sarah!
