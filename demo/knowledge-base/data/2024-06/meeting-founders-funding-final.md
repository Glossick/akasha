## Discussion

Henry: This is it. We need to decide today. They want an answer by Monday.

Steven: $2.5M valuation feels low. We have 10 customers, growing revenue, product-market fit is there.

Henry: I agree it's lower than I hoped. I was targeting $3-4M. But the market is tough right now for pre-seed. Other founders I've talked to are seeing similar or worse terms.

Steven: What's our dilution?

Henry: 20%. We'd each go from 50% to 40%. Still maintain control.

Steven: And $500k gives us how much runway?

Henry: 18 months if we're disciplined. That's enough to get to $50k MRR and raise a proper Series A. We can hire 2-3 people—definitely an engineer for you, probably another sales/CS person for me.

Steven: What happens if we say no?

Henry: We have maybe 3 months of runway left. We'd need to cut costs dramatically—no hiring, minimal spending. We could try to get profitable on current revenue ($3k/month) but that seems impossible without growing, and we can't grow without hiring.

Steven: So it's take the money or die slowly.

Henry: Basically, yeah. Unless we think we can find a better term sheet in the next month, which I doubt.

Steven: I hate that we're in this position. But I trust your judgment on the fundraising market. If this is the best offer we're going to get, let's take it.

Henry: You're sure? I don't want you to resent this decision later.

Steven: I'm sure. I want to build this company. I want to hire help. I want to not be burned out. $500k makes all that possible. Let's do it.

Henry: Okay. I'll tell Catalyst we're accepting. We close next week and get the money by end of June.

Steven: What's first priority with the money?

Henry: Hire an engineer for you. ASAP. Get that job posting up tomorrow, start interviews next week. You need relief immediately.

Steven: Thank you. For real.

Henry: We're in this together, man. Always.

## Decision: ACCEPT term sheet from Catalyst Ventures
- Henry to sign documents Monday
- Funds expected by June 30
- Begin hiring process for engineer immediately
