# Customer Call: PrecisionEng Product Feedback
**Date**: June 20, 2024
**Attendees**: Sarah, Steven, Jennifer (PrecisionEng Engineering Manager)
**Type**: Product Feedback / Feature Request

## Call Notes

Sarah: Jennifer, thanks for making time. You've been one of our most engaged customers—your team has submitted 47 feature requests in the past two months.

Jennifer: We love the product. It's transformed our estimation process. That's WHY we have so many requests—we see the potential and we want EstiMate to be perfect for our workflow.

Steven: We appreciate the feedback. It helps us prioritize. What are your top 3 must-haves?

Jennifer: 
1. **Webhooks** - We need real-time notifications when estimates are completed so we can trigger downstream processes in our project management system.
2. **Advanced permissions** - Right now it's all-or-nothing access. We need role-based permissions. Not everyone should be able to edit pricing assumptions.
3. **Version history** - When someone modifies an estimate, we need to see what changed and when. Audit trail is critical for us.

Sarah: Those are all solid requests. Steven, what's the realistic timeline?

Steven: Webhooks are in progress, should ship in July. Advanced permissions and version history are bigger lifts—probably Q3 at the earliest. We're a small team and we have to balance feature development with maintaining the system for all our customers.

Jennifer: I understand. And I don't want to sound demanding, but these aren't nice-to-haves for us. They're blockers for expanding EstiMate to our entire organization. Right now we have 12 users. We could have 50 users if we had these features, which means a big contract expansion.

Sarah: That's valuable context. So this is about growing within your organization, not just improving the existing user experience.

Jennifer: Exactly. I have budget for more seats, but I need these governance features to get buy-in from our VP of Operations. He's very concerned about security and auditability.

Steven: Got it. Let me see if we can prioritize advanced permissions higher. Version history might need to wait, but if permissions are blocking a 4x expansion of your team, that's a strong business case.

Jennifer: I appreciate that. One more thing—can I get a rough pricing estimate for 50 users? We're on the Professional plan at $299, which caps at 50 users. Would we need Enterprise?

Sarah: Technically yes, Enterprise is unlimited users at $999/month. But for you, given how much you've helped shape the product, we'd keep you on Professional even at 50 users. Call it a product partner discount.

Jennifer: That's generous. Thank you. If you can deliver on webhooks in July and permissions by September, I'll have 50 users on the platform by Q4. That's a commitment.

Steven: Deal. We'll make it happen.

## Post-Call Internal Notes

**Sarah**: PrecisionEng could be our biggest account if we execute. $299/month now, potentially $999/month if they keep growing. They're also our best feedback source.

**Steven**: Agreed. I'm moving advanced permissions up the priority list. It's not just PrecisionEng—other enterprise customers will need this too. It's foundational.

**Henry** (via Slack): Love this. PrecisionEng is the kind of customer that pulls us up-market. Let's over-deliver for them.
