# Six-Month Retrospective: EstiMate Journey
**Date**: June 28, 2024
**Author**: Henry (with input from Steven and Sarah)

## Where We Started (January 2024)
- 2 founders, no revenue, $50k in savings
- MVP product, basic features, monolith architecture
- First customer: BuildCorp at $99/month

## Where We Are Now (June 2024)
- 3 employees (Henry, Steven, Sarah)
- 10 customers across construction, consulting, design
- $3,600/month in recurring revenue
- Just closed $500k seed round from Catalyst Ventures
- Product: API shipped, PDF customization, performance optimized

## Key Metrics
- **Customers**: 1 → 10 (10x growth)
- **MRR**: $99 → $3,600 (36x growth)
- **Team**: 2 → 3 (50% growth)
- **Features Shipped**: 12 major features
- **Estimates Processed**: 4,200+ across all customers
- **Time Saved for Customers**: ~2,400 hours (estimated)

## What Went Well

### Product Execution
- Shipped consistently despite being a tiny team
- Performance optimization worked—no microservices needed (yet)
- API launch was successful, customers love it
- Product quality is high, very few bugs

### Customer Success
- Saved MegaConstruct from churning through quick response and flexible pricing
- PrecisionEng became power user and product champion
- BuildCorp referred 2 new customers (UrbanDesign, EcoConstruct)
- Customer feedback loop is strong—we know what they need

### Fundraising
- Closed $500k in challenging market
- 18 months of runway secured
- Can now hire and grow properly

## What Was Hard

### Founder Burnout
- Steven hit breaking point in May
- Working unsustainable hours for months
- Hiring Sarah helped but not enough
- Need to scale team much faster going forward

### Pricing Confusion
- Changed pricing mid-year, caused customer confusion
- MegaConstruct almost churned due to poor communication
- Grandfather pricing creates complexity long-term
- Still don't have perfect pricing model figured out

### Feature Prioritization
- Constant debate about what to build next
- Every customer wants something different
- PDF vs API debate took too long to resolve
- Need better product management discipline

### Technical Debt
- Monolith vs microservices debate was draining
- Made the right call but Steven still worried about long-term scalability
- Some shortcuts taken to ship fast will need to be fixed
- Need to hire engineer ASAP to share load

## Lessons Learned

**On Product**: Ship fast, iterate based on real customer feedback. Don't over-engineer.

**On Pricing**: Communicate changes clearly. Grandfather clauses are good but complicated. Be transparent about value.

**On Hiring**: Should have hired Sarah sooner. Should have hired engineer by now. Team scale is critical.

**On Customers**: Enterprise customers are demanding but valuable. Small customers are easier but lower revenue. Need both.

**On Fundraising**: Start earlier than you think. Market is unpredictable. Terms won't be perfect—focus on getting it done.

**On Founders**: Check in on each other's mental health. Easy to ignore warning signs when you're heads-down. Burnout is real.

## Next Six Months (July-December 2024)

### Goals
- Grow to 25 customers
- $15k MRR (5x growth)
- Hire 2-3 more people (engineer, sales/CS)
- Ship advanced permissions, webhooks, version history
- Expand into larger enterprise accounts
- Establish product-market fit beyond early adopters

### Risks to Watch
- Competition (ConstructFlow, others) launching similar features
- Technical scalability as we grow
- Keeping team motivated and healthy
- Managing customer expectations as we grow
- Balancing feature development with technical debt

## Personal Reflections

**Henry**: This has been the hardest and most rewarding thing I've ever done. We built something people genuinely value. That matters. But we almost broke Steven in the process, and that's on me for not seeing it sooner. Going forward, team health is as important as growth metrics.

**Steven**: I'm proud of what we built but I'm not proud of how close I came to quitting in May. We need to hire faster and delegate more. I can't be the only engineer anymore. And I need to get better at saying "no" to customers when their requests aren't feasible. But overall—we're building something real, and that's awesome.

**Sarah**: I joined in March and it's been a whirlwind. EstiMate has incredible potential. The product works, customers love it, the market is huge. We just need to scale ourselves as fast as we're scaling the business. I'm excited about what's next.

---

**Conclusion**: Six months ago this was an idea. Today it's a real company with real customers and real revenue. We made mistakes but we learned from them. The next six months will be about scaling—more customers, more team, more impact. Let's go.
