🎉🎉🎉 IT'S OFFICIAL! Funds hit the bank account. $500k from Catalyst Ventures. We closed the round!

**Steven** [3:48 PM]
YESSSSSS

**Sarah** [3:49 PM]
Congrats you two!!! This is huge!

**Henry** [3:52 PM]
First priority: hiring. Steven, let's get that engineer job posting live tomorrow. Sarah, let's also think about a CS/sales hire to support you.

**Steven** [3:55 PM]
Already drafted the job description. Senior Full-Stack Engineer, $120-150k + equity. Posting it today.

**Sarah** [3:57 PM]
I'd love help on the CS side. Maybe someone who can handle tier 1 support tickets so I can focus on strategic accounts.

**Henry** [4:00 PM]
Done. Let's plan to make 2-3 hires in Q3. We have the runway now.

**Steven** [4:03 PM]
This means I can actually take PTO without feeling guilty. And maybe work normal hours?

**Henry** [4:05 PM]
YES. That's the whole point. No more 14-hour days. We're building a sustainable company now, not a burnout factory.

**Sarah** [4:08 PM]
What should we do to celebrate? Dinner? Drinks?

**Henry** [4:10 PM]
Definitely. Friday night, wherever you both want to go. Company's buying. 

**Steven** [4:12 PM]
I'm just happy we don't have to panic about running out of money every week.

**Henry** [4:15 PM]
Same. This gives us 18 months to get to $50k MRR and raise Series A. We have actual runway to execute our vision.

**Sarah** [4:18 PM]
Here's to the next chapter 🥂

**Henry** [4:20 PM]
We earned this. Every stressful moment, every late night, every hard decision—it led to this. Let's keep building.
