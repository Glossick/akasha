# Internal Doc: New Pricing Tiers Launch
**Date**: April 1, 2024
**Author**: Henry

## Overview
Today we launched our new tiered pricing model. This replaces our flat $99/month pricing with three tiers designed to segment customers by size and needs.

## Pricing Tiers

### Starter - $99/month
- Up to 10 users
- 100 estimates per month
- Basic PDF export
- Email support (48hr response time)
- **Target**: Small contractors, design firms (1-15 employees)

### Professional - $299/month
- Up to 50 users
- Unlimited estimates
- Custom PDF branding
- API access
- Priority support (24hr response time)
- **Target**: Mid-size construction, consulting firms (15-100 employees)

### Enterprise - $999/month
- Unlimited users
- Unlimited estimates
- Everything in Professional
- SSO (coming soon)
- Dedicated account manager
- Custom integrations support
- **Target**: Large enterprises (100+ employees)

## Existing Customer Grandfather Clause
All customers who signed before April 1, 2024 are grandfathered at $99/month for 12 months. This includes:
- BuildCorp
- ConsultPro
- DesignHub
- TinyBuilders
- MegaConstruct

After 12 months (April 2025), they'll migrate to the appropriate tier based on usage.

## Expected Impact
- **Revenue**: Should see 3x increase in ACV (average contract value) for new customers
- **Sales**: Clearer value prop, easier to sell into enterprises
- **Product**: Gives us permission to build enterprise features (SSO, advanced security)

## Risks
- Existing customers might react negatively if they feel we're "leaving them behind"
- $999 Enterprise tier might be too expensive for our current market
- We don't have all the features yet (SSO, advanced integrations) that justify Enterprise pricing

## Next Steps
- Monitor new signups by tier
- Gather feedback from sales conversations
- Build out missing Enterprise features (SSO, advanced audit logs)
- Consider usage-based add-ons (extra storage, API call limits)

## Team Notes
**Sarah**: "I like the structure but we need better support infrastructure for the higher tiers. 24hr response time means I need help or we need to set up proper on-call rotation."

**Steven**: "Enterprise tier makes me nervous. We're promising features we don't have. I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver."

**Henry**: "I hear you both. Let's be honest with prospects about what's available now vs coming soon. And Sarah, you're right—we need to hire support/CS help soon."
