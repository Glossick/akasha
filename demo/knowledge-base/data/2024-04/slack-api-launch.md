# Slack Conversation: API Launch
**Date**: April 30, 2024
**Channel**: #team

🚀 API is live! Version 1.0, full REST API with authentication, rate limiting, webhooks (beta). Docs are at api.estimate.com/docs

**Henry** [4:25 PM]
HUGE! This opens up so many sales opportunities. Great work Steven.

**Sarah** [4:26 PM]
ConsultPro is going to be thrilled. They've been asking about this since February.

**Steven** [4:30 PM]
Yeah I already emailed them and PrecisionEng. Both have developers ready to integrate. I'll be on standby for support questions as they get started.

**Henry** [4:32 PM]
This is a major product milestone. We can now compete for enterprise customers who require integrations. API access is a checkbox item on most RFPs.

**Steven** [4:35 PM]
One caveat: webhooks are beta. They work but I want to see real-world usage before calling them production-ready. I documented that clearly in the API docs.

**Sarah** [4:38 PM]
Makes sense. I'll set expectations with customers that webhooks are early access.

**Henry** [4:40 PM]
Steven, seriously, this is awesome. I know the PDF vs API debate was tough, but shipping both within 6 weeks is incredible.

**Steven** [4:42 PM]
Thanks. I'm proud of it. Now I just need to not break it 😅

**Henry** [4:45 PM]
🍾 Celebrating tonight!
