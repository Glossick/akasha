# Decision Log: PDF Customization vs API Priority
**Date**: February 23, 2024
**Decision Maker**: Henry, Steven
**Status**: Resolved

## Context
We have two competing feature requests:
1. **PDF Customization** (requested by BuildCorp) - Allow custom branding, logos, formatting in exported PDFs
2. **API Development** (requested by ConsultPro) - REST API for integrations with external systems

We can only prioritize one for March delivery.

## Arguments For PDF Customization
- **Henry's perspective**: 
  - Faster to build (2-3 weeks)
  - Useful for sales demos—makes product look more professional
  - BuildCorp is our champion customer, wants to show EstiMate to other companies
  - Tangible, visible feature that impresses prospects
  
## Arguments For API Priority
- **Steven's perspective**:
  - More strategic long-term—unlocks enterprise customers
  - ConsultPro is 4x the size of BuildCorp, can't ignore them
  - API enables integrations (QuickBooks, Salesforce, etc.) which is huge for sales
  - I'm already halfway through the API work

## The Debate
**Henry**: "I get that API is important, but we need to close deals NOW. I have 3 sales calls next week and custom PDFs would help me close them. The API can wait a month."

**Steven**: "But if we delay the API again, ConsultPro will get frustrated. They're already pushing back on the $99 price point. If we don't deliver what they need, they might churn."

**Henry**: "ConsultPro isn't going to churn over a one-month delay. They're locked in. But if I can't show custom PDFs in my demos, I might lose the new deals."

**Steven**: "This feels short-term thinking. We need to build for scale, not just close this month's deals."

## Resolution
After a heated discussion, we decided to **prioritize PDF customization for March**, with API to follow in April.

**Rationale**:
- PDF is genuinely faster to ship (2-3 weeks vs 6-8 weeks for full API)
- We can deliver something to BuildCorp quickly, keeping our champion happy
- ConsultPro can wait one more month—we'll communicate the timeline clearly
- API in April still aligns with new pricing launch, which makes sense

**Steven is not thrilled with this decision but accepts it for the sake of moving forward.**

## Commitment
- PDF customization ships by March 15
- API development continues in parallel, ships by April 30
- We communicate timelines to both BuildCorp and ConsultPro this week
